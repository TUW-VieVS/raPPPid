## Getting Started
You need a recent Matlab installation. raPPPid is extensively tested on Windows and also works on Linux. Download or clone the raPPPid repository from GitHub, for example, with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/TUW-VieVS/raPPPid
```
Start Matlab and change the Matlab work folder to the WORK folder of raPPPid, which is a subfolder of the program (/raPPPid/WORK/). Start the Graphical User Interface (GUI) with the function raPPPid.m. You might type the following command into the command window: 
```
raPPPid
```


## Processing Examples
Check the raPPPid wiki: https://vievswiki.geo.tuwien.ac.at/en/raPPPid/table_of_content

raPPPid provides functions to download GNSS observation data (e.g., DownloadDaily30sIGS). All other input data is downloaded automatically.


## Troubleshooting
Pull the latest raPPPid version from GitHub in case of bugs or errors. 

If this does not help, please send a short report, the RINEX file, and settings.mat to raPPPid@geo.tuwien.ac.at
